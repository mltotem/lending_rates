# lending_rates
Used Kaggle Lending Club dataset to verify interest rate on default loans is higher than current loans, ie risk model performs well.

Need to add more data visualization plots (violin plots) and walk over more detailed tests.
Can also run multiple tests to run more A/B test and provide more insights.

The dataset is ~1Gb so not in repo.
